An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer hardware. 
The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.
An operating system is software that manages the computer hardware. 
The hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system.
Internally, operating systems vary greatly in their makeup, since they
are organized along many different lines. The design of a new operating
system is a major task, and it is important that the goals of the system be
well defined before the design begins.
Because an operating system is large and complex, it must be created piece by piece. Each of these pieces should be a well-delineated
portion of the system, with carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions.
